# BOT-Leif
Source 2 based CS:GO bot hosted in Stockholm, Sweden. This bot uses various machine learning algorithms to identify its surroundings in the environment of Counter Strike: Global Offensive. The bot is currently in development and will launch on the release date of Source 2.

The development of Leif began in 2019 upon the release of operation Shattered Web. The bot is learning the basics of the game on its steam account which you can find at the web address https://steamcommunity.com/id/botleifs2. If you would like to support the project you can give Leif a trade offer to give it skins which will be automatically equipped upon the completion of the exchange.

The newest stable build of Leif is 0.43 which added smoke lineups to its arsenal. The bot is stil in early development so its accomplishments in-game aren't very good. The best result is achieved via the usage of single shot weapons like shotguns and pistols. When in-game, Leif analyzes the player movements and overall behavior to implement them in itself.
